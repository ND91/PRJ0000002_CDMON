The idea is to uplift the annotation files from the Illumina HumanMethylation BeadChip arrays from hg19/GRCh37 to GRCh38.

#Illumina HumanMethylation 450k BeadChip Array

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
require(IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19)
data(IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19)
```
